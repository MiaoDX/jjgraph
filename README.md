# jjgraph, a rather old graph drawing and algorithm library.

There are probably better ones out there these days, but it may contain some useful algorithms or approaches not covered anywhere else.

## ![One screen shot of the software](pics/demo.png)
This pic is produced by the software with `gml/dolphins.gml` and change the layout by `Cicular layout` and `Cicular layout + Orthogonal`.(Seems nice,right?)

To make a quick start, you can just load files in `gml` dictionary and play with different algorithms and layouts.

And if you're a windows user, chances are that the codes will not run so smoothly, see [`windows_helper.md`](windows_helper.md) for more info.

There is an old paper seems highly relevant with this software [The Metro Map Layout Problem](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-31843-9_50) :
